# Welcome to dRhooks

dRhooks is a carefully curated collection of beautiful UI components and powerful React hooks built on top of [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/). Our components and hooks are designed to accelerate your development workflow while maintaining the highest standards of accessibility and performance.

</Cards>

## Core Philosophy

This project follows the same principles that make `shadcn/ui` great:

* **Built on a Solid Foundation:** Every component is built on top of Radix UI primitives and styled with Tailwind CSS, inheriting the same quality and accessibility you'd expect. 
* **Just Copy & Paste:** This is not an installable library. Simply find a component you like, copy its code directly into your project, and customize it to fit your needs. The code is yours. 
* **Open & Free:** All components are free to use for both personal and commercial projects, just like `shadcn/ui`.


## Getting Started

<Steps>
### Install Prerequisites
First, ensure you have shadcn/ui installed and configured in your project:

```npm
npx shadcn-ui@latest init
```

### Choose Components
Browse our component library and select the ones you need for your project.

### Copy & Paste
Copy the component code and paste it into your project's components directory.

### Start Using
Import and use the component in your application. Customize it to match your needs.
</Steps>

## Quick Example

```tsx
import { BounceButton } from '@/components/ui/bounce-button'

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <BounceButton>
      Click me!
    </BounceButton>
  )
}
```

  Make sure to install any peer dependencies required by the components you're using. Each component's documentation lists its required dependencies.
