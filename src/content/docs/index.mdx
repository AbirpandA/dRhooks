description: Get started with dRhooks, a curated collection of components designed to extend shadcn/ui.
---

Welcome to dRhooks! This is a personal collection of beautifully designed and reusable UI components created to supercharge your projects built with [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/). 

This registry extends the core `shadcn/ui` library with many useful and unique components to help you build stunning user interfaces even faster. 

## Core Philosophy

This project follows the same principles that make `shadcn/ui` great:

* **Built on a Solid Foundation:** Every component is built on top of Radix UI primitives and styled with Tailwind CSS, inheriting the same quality and accessibility you'd expect. 
* **Just Copy & Paste:** This is not an installable library. Simply find a component you like, copy its code directly into your project, and customize it to fit your needs. The code is yours. 
* **Open & Free:** All components are free to use for both personal and commercial projects, just like `shadcn/ui`.

## Getting Started

Adding a component to your project is simple.

### 1. Prerequisite: Install shadcn/ui

Before you begin, you must have `shadcn/ui` installed and configured in your project.  If you haven't, please follow the official [installation guide](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation) first. 

### 2. Add a Component

Browse the component library, copy the source code of your chosen component, and paste it into a new file within your project's `components` directory. That's it!
